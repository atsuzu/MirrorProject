Sean's Mirror + Voice Recognition + SoundCloud + Character moving project

1: Mirror

Basically wanted to make a mirror that had date, time, and weather information.

2: Voice Recognition
I then decided to add a voice recognition to automate stuff in my room.
I used Annyang, which uses Google API

3:  SoundCloud
I added this to combine with Voice Recognition, so basically I can command it to: start, pause, skip music.

4: Character
I used MMD (MikuMikuDance) to create a moving character model.  Apparently RPi does not support webGL, and so I decided to 2D.  So what I did was just take frame images and play it using javascript.
